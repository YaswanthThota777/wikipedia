CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. It is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable by handling the look and feel of the web content. CSS allows you to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
